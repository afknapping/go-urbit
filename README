# Communicate with Urbit ships using Go

At the moment the best way to learn how to use it is to look at the
commented examples.  Run them with `go run <EXAMPLE_NAME>.go`.  For
all of them you need to pass `--addr ADDRESS` and `--code CODE` with
the address and code of the ship.

For notes about the development of the library see NOTES.
